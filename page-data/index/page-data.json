Python has a rich ecosystem of 3rd party libraries including often offical bindings for an external service.

Django's popularity and architecture provides the opportuntiy to find many existing solutions to common problems.  For education and discussion, I thought it would be helpful to enumerate the many libraries we currently use on Subblime to leverage the power of of the Python/Django ecosystem.
